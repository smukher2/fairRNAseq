# FAIRwissenschaft  
# Warning: This project is protected by copyright. Copyright © 2023-2024 Shradha Mukherjee. All rights reserved. Albeit, because this project is an attempt to standardise, increase transparency and give credit where its due, it must be widely accesible to everyone. So I am making this #FAIRwissenschaft project open access and not for sale i.e. its 'science for sake of science, art for sake of art' to quote Sherlock Holmes and not for my personal/professional profit.  

## Significance (Why?): For FAIR Wissenschaft and fair Wissenschaft.  
### Wissenschaft is German word meaning knowledge from both science and humanities. This was first popularised and introduced in pursuit of knowledge through education and research at University of Berlin by Alexander von Humboldt, and continues to be the gold standard model for organizations such as academia (ref1, ref2, ref3, ref4). Alexander von Humboldt integrated scientific facts and scientific communication with artistic flair in his work, and used to get his scientific writing reviewed by poets Goethe and Schiller. Indeed, Alexander von Humboldt was a pioneed in recognising and integrating science and art/humanities, in his work (ref5, ref6, ref7, ref8, ref9). This is something computation, especially AI is doing now, so Alexander von Humboldt was a visionary, ahead of his time. Computation, especially AI has made scientific and humanities methods of data analysis, and fact finding more comparable, consistent and interdependent than ever. So no longer can sciences and humanities, live in organization silos, but they now cross-talk with each other, enrich knowledge of each other, and thus need to be considered under umbrella of one common term that designates research and education in both sciences and humanities. This common knowledge umbrella term that signifies education and research in all knowledge domains is Wissenschaft which is not available in French or English. Historically, English, French and German languages have contributed words to each other enriching each other, so its possible that Wissenschaft will become part of English and French too.  
### Here the word FAIR and fair are used as an acronym and as meaning just/justice, respectively. FAIR is acronym for Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable. FAIR (ref10, ref11, ref12, ref13). Reproducibility and reusability problem, is not limited to scientific data, techniques and discoveries but also applies to humanities i.e. economics/law/journalism/arts, knowledge domains. Therefore, broadly speaking its not FAIR science peoject but FAIR wissenschaft project. Fair or just, is giving credit where its due to original work and protecting against plagiarism i.e. use of original work without citation and/or permission (ref14, ref15, ref16). This plagiarism problem, is not limited to scientific data, techniques and discoveries but also applies to humanities i.e. economics/law/journalism/arts, knowledge domains. Therefore, broadly speaking its not fair science project but fair wissenschaft project.

### Goals
Human overpopulation induced loss of biodiversity and climate change are the greatest challenges of present times. This complex problem will require complex solutions that an interdisciplinay application of STEAM knowledge with AI can provide. To fulfill this need of the hour, FAIRwissenschaft aims to be a STEAM (and AI) learning resource by adding multidisciplinary context to the fantastic 133's interdisciplinary work. As an interdisciplinary scientist and as a human being, it is my dream and duty to do FAIRwissenschaft project as a small token of thanks to the fantastic 133, STEAM disciplines and planet Earth for my life and work.  

The money thus made from sale of FAIRwissenschaft Project, will be used to fund 'planetarian work' focused on developing interdiciplinary STEAM mechanisms to solve human over population problem, the root of all planet earth's problems. Most existing funds are provided for humanitarian work, such as healthcare, with limited funds dedicated to environmental science and biodiveristy conservation. All these existing funds, sidestep the root cause of (non-human) biodiversity extinction, destruction of nature, and loss of human quality of life, which is human overpopulation (explained here: Inferno Extended Scene - Zobrists Presentation - YouTube https://youtu.be/6Z40g6Qsuk8?si=AeP6bSYFi_MI6MnH). The present human population is atleast 2/3rd in excess. To solve this lack of funds for tackling root cause of all our problems, namely human overpopulation, money made from sale of FAIRwissenschaft Project, will be used to fund Planetarian Project that aims at to stop human overpopulation, and save planet earth. As opposed to humanitarian work, planetarian work is focused on saving planet earth and its endangered non-human biodiversity, especially by stifling human overpopulation. When planet earth and its endangered non-human biodiversity is saved, quality of life for humans can be improved.  

### Methods or Tools  
The foundation of FAIRwissenschaft Project heavily utilizes the work of fantastic 133 and heavily utilises science and technology from UK, Germany, France, Switzerland, Austria, Poland, Belgium, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, China, Japan, South Korea and US.

### Values  
FAIRwissenschaft Project is based on three core values:  
1) 'Lernbegierde' (German word, means 'desire to learn')  
2) 'Problemlösungswunsch' (German word, means 'desire to solve problems')  
3) 'Endziele' (German word, means end goal or long-term goal):'Enable talent' means not only to enable talented individuals realize their full potential by encouraging their inherent 'Lernbegierde' and 'Problemlösungswunsch' values (these values come naturally to them), but 'enable talent' also means safeguarding talented individuals from untalented/parasitic/deceiptful individuals who do not have 'Lernbegierde' and/or 'Problemlösungswunsch' values. Taking analogy of host-parasite relations in biology, untalented individuals are parasites that disable talented individuals their host, by extracting free food, free rides and by using sabotage/deceipt. 'Enable talent' value is consistent with Natural Laws of Evolution, namely 'survival of the fittest', by which Mother Nature ensures survival of fittest (talented individuals) and elimination of the unfit (untalented individuals). Furthermore, another long-term goal of FAIRwissenschaft is to garner funds that can fund 'Planatarian' work. As explained before, 'planetarian' work as opposed to humanitarian work is focused on solving root cause of planet earth’s problems, namely human overpopulation so that planet earth and its endangered non-human biodiversity can be saved, and quality of life for humans can be improved.
